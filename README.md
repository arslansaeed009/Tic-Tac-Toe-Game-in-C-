# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-C++
A console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C++. The game features a simple AI opponent and allows two players to take turns playing the game.
## Features
- **Player vs. Computer:** Play against a basic AI opponent.
- **Win and Draw Detection:** Detect win and draw conditions.
- **Simple User Interface:** Console-based interaction for moves.
  ## Technologies Used
- **C++: The programming language used for development.**
  ## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- **A C++ compiler (such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC).**
- **A development environment (such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any IDE of your choice).**
  ## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-game.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
    ```sh
    cd tic-tac-toe-game
3. Compile the Source Code:
   ```sh
   g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp
4. Run the Executable:
   ```sh
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```
   ## Usage
- **Follow the prompts to make your move as either Player X or Player O.**
- **The game alternates turns between the player and the computer.**
- **The game ends when there is a winner or the board is full (draw).**
## How It Works
- **Initialization: Sets up the game board and initializes player settings.**
- **Player Moves: Handles player input for moves.**
- **Computer Moves: Implements a basic AI to make moves for the computer.**
- **Win and Draw Detection: Checks the game state to determine the outcome.**
## Limitations
- **The computer opponent has a simple strategy of placing a move in the first available spot.**
- **No advanced AI or strategy for computer moves.**
  ## Future Enhancements
- **Improve computer AI with more sophisticated algorithms.**
- **Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.**
- **Implement multiplayer support over a network.**
